### Hiya!
My name is Zach Zundel, and I am a Computer Science/Bioengineering B.Eng. student at the University of Utah.
My current research involves the development of the [Synthetic Biology Open Language](http://sbolstandard.org) and related tooling, namely, [SynBioHub](https://synbiohub.org).

My computing-related interests include <mark>standardization</mark>, the <mark>semantic web</mark>, and <mark>making computers friendlier</mark>.

When I'm not ~~breaking~~ using my computer, I like <mark>backpacking</mark> in the mountains surrounding Salt Lake City.
